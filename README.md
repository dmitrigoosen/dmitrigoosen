- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmitrigoosen
- 👀 I’m interested in ... updating FullName independent of username? emoji font in Markdown. Diagrams? :) then MD can be just like DocuWiki, and we can stay within TEXT world. Also wonder where will it bring down the word-wrap? with indent or not?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... XAML, meta-programming.
- 📫 How to reach me ... i ll post email here if decide to keep this Intro.

- ⚒ strangely though same font as above (Segoe UI Emoji) but the crossed hammers are not displayed as Icons.
- ⚖ - and neither are the scales... the web-dev world... Done in seconds, but works only "kind of" )
